            <p><strong>Commemorating International Women’s Day with Commercetools Women in Tech</strong></p>
            <p>Possessing a strong background in B2B technology marketing, I'm customarily attuned to the dynamic nature of the tech industry. Nevertheless, being a part of commercetools has introduced me to a different sphere of tech, more distinct, more diverse, and more empowering. We champion the concept of equity, propelling the evolution of the industry through our exceptional women leaders.</p>
            <p>Our Women in Tech ERG, a brainchild of Marlies Isabella Riepl and me, stemmed from our shared vision of creating a supportive ecosystem that could tap into and amplify the power and potential of all women in the tech industry. We're a community more than 120 strong now - never had we imagined that our little idea would transform into a tidal wave of diversity and empowerment.</p>
            <p>Honoring International Women’s Day this year with the theme #EmbraceEquity, we invited five pioneering women to reveal how they embrace equity in their profession. The responses we received were enlightening. This came on the heels of commercetools raising the bar on gender inclusivity with my appointment as the first Chief Marketing Officer, making me even more vested in our cause.</p>
            <p>Being part of the Empowered CMO Summit broadened my panoramas, allowing me to interact and engage with innumerable women CMOs. The shared experiences rendered valuable insights - from leadership lessons to winning strategies, and most critically, overcoming challenges that came our way.</p>
            <p>Secrets of success aren't classified information here at commercetools. We believe in learning from each other, drawing from our experiences, and understanding that each struggle can be transformed into a stepping stone. I firmly believe that lessons learned at the Summit could be instrumental for our ERG members, providing them with the resource they need to embrace equity within the global demographic.</p>
            <p>And for those keen on understanding our journey, experiences, and how the Women in tech ERG navigates through their challenges, I invite you to explore a recent blog post I chanced upon. It perfectly encapsulates our voyage thus far 'Embracing Equity on International Women’s Day with commercetools Women in Tech ERG'.</p>
            <p>Let's commit to amplify equity and inclusion, driving forward the tech industry, one step at a time.</p>
