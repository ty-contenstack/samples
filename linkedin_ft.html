            <p>I just read a great blog post on women in B2B tech. I appreciate knowing women CMOs through the Empowered CMO Summit. I think past examples of facing challenges are useful to share, but I also love to focus on the present and future.</p>
            <p>I didn't grow up dreaming of being a CMO, but here I am â€” and I'm loving it! I'm excited for the next generation of women and whatever they choose to pursue.</p>
