<h1>Introducing Claude 3: The next generation of responsible AI on AWS Bedrock</h1>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the general availability of Claude 3, the next generation of responsible AI, on AWS Bedrock. Claude 3 is a family of models that includes Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. These models are designed to provide a blend of speed, intelligence, and cost-efficiency for a wide range of use cases.</p>

<p>Claude 3 is available globally through the Claude API and select platforms. You can try it today and send feedback to AWS re:Post for Amazon Bedrock or through your usual AWS Support contacts.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we’ll introduce you to the Claude 3 model family and highlight some of the use cases for these models.</p>

<h1>Meet the Claude 3 model family</h1>

<p>The Claude 3 model family includes three advanced models: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Each model is designed to excel in different areas, allowing you to choose the right model for your specific use case.</p>

<h2>Haiku</h2>

<p>Haiku is the fastest model in the Claude 3 family. It is optimized for speed and is ideal for customer interactions that require a quick response. Haiku is also available in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) Regions, making it a great choice for customers who require low latency in these regions.</p>

<p>With Haiku, you can get a response in as little as 50 milliseconds. This makes it perfect for a wide range of use cases, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer service applications.</p>

<p>In addition to its speed, Haiku is also the most cost-effective model in the Claude 3 family. It is 68% the price of Claude Instant, making it a great choice for customers who are looking to save money while still getting high-quality results.</p>

<h2>Sonnet</h2>

<p>Sonnet is the second-fastest model in the Claude 3 family. It is optimized for rapid responses and is ideal for business automation use cases. With Sonnet, you can get a response in as little as 100 milliseconds, making it perfect for applications that require real-time interaction.</p>

<p>Sonnet is also highly accurate, with a word error rate (WER) of less than 5%. This means that you can rely on Sonnet to provide accurate responses, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>In addition to its speed and accuracy, Sonnet also has a longer context window than Haiku, allowing it to better understand and process longer inputs. This makes it a great choice for a wide range of use cases, including document summarization, content generation, and more.</p>

<h2>Opus</h2>

<p>Opus is the most intelligent model in the Claude 3 family. It is optimized for cognitive tasks and has near-human comprehension, allowing it to understand and process information at a level that is almost indistinguishable from a human.</p>

<p>With Opus, you can get highly accurate and nuanced responses, making it perfect for a wide range of use cases, including data processing, analysis, and interpretation. Opus is also enhanced with sophisticated vision capabilities, allowing it to understand and process visual information, further expanding its range of applications.</p>

<p>In addition to its intelligence, Opus also has fewer refusals than the other models in the Claude 3 family, ensuring a higher completion rate for a wide range of tasks.</p>
